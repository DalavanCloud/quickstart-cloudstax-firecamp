## CloudStax FireCamp on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start helps you deploy CloudStax FireCamp on the AWS Cloud.

Use FireCamp to create, manage, and scale stateful services, such as Redis, Cassandra, MongoDB, Kafka, PostgreSQL, or Elasticsearch, on AWS.  

[FireCamp](https://github.com/cloudstax/firecamp/) is an open-source platform for managing stateful services in containers. It supports your choice of two container orchestration services: Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Docker Swarm.
FireCamp makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale stateful services on AWS, using three Availability Zones for high availability and automatic failover.   

The AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start automate the following:

- Deploying CloudStax FireCamp into a new VPC
- Deploying CloudStax FireCamp into an existing VPC

You can customize the templates to meet your specific requirements. For detailed information about the architecture and step-by-step instructions, see the deployment guide.
